My First Repository:
Matt Teixeira here, 
This is my first of many repositories. I am a scientist and data analyst for a consulting firm in Charlotte North Carolina. My mid/long term goal is to take the enjoyment I receive from dabbling in front end web development and turn that into a career. In the meantime, I am utilizing much of my free time to honing my HTML and CSS skills. Update 11/23/21: I have shifted much of my development time from working in HTML/CSS to pure vanilla JavaScript. However, HTML and CSS has piqued my interest. There certainly is a science behind understanding and applying HTML/CSS to a website, which outputs a well-structured/functional page; however, there is a subjective aspect of it I am really enjoying. Perhaps it’s because I’m far from being an artist, but the challenges of applying CSS to a page, making it ascetically pleasing, and having confidence in your work as it comes together, has brough me much satisfaction. 
After a few more weeks of CSS practice, I intend to move on to more JS related training and then move on over to React. I will begin attending a full stack bootcamp, through UNC Charlotte, on January 18th, 2022. I am excited to have finally found the resolve I needed to begin this awesome quest in becoming a developer. I expect the journey will be arduous. Being a scientist and full time father/husband commands much of my waking hours as it is. However, I know that putting my head down and relying on my grit, will propel me to my first development position. 
If you have taken the time to read this, I sincerely give you my thanks. Time is a finite resource, which should be used with discretion.
Thank you
